This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great picture from sunrise.

> Sunrise (or Sun up) is the moment when the upper limb of the Sun appears on the horizon in the morning. The term can also refer to the entire process of the solar disk crossing the horizon and its accompanying atmospheric effects.
